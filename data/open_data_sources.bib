  abstract = {Municipal wastewater provides an integrated sample of a diversity of human-associated microbes across a sewershed, including viruses. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a promising strategy to detect pathogens and may serve as an early warning system for disease outbreaks. Notably, WBE has garnered substantial interest during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to track disease burden through analyses of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA. Throughout the COVID-19 outbreak, tracking SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater has been an important tool for understanding the spread of the virus. Unlike traditional sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from clinical samples, which adds testing burden to the health care system, in this study, metatranscriptomics was used to sequence virus directly from wastewater. Here, we present a study in which we explored RNA viral diversity through sequencing 94 wastewater influent samples across seven wastewater treatment plants (WTPs), collected from August 2020 to January 2021, representing approximately 16 million people in Southern California. Enriched viral libraries identified a wide diversity of RNA viruses that differed between WTPs and over time, with detected viruses including coronaviruses, influenza A, and noroviruses. Furthermore, single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) of SARSCoV-2 were identified in wastewater, and we measured proportions of overall virus and SNVs across several months. We detected several SNVs that are markers for clinically important SARS-CoV-2 variants along with SNVs of unknown function, prevalence, or epidemiological consequence. Our study shows the potential of WBE to detect viruses in wastewater and to track the diversity and spread of viral variants in urban and suburban locations, which may aid public health efforts to monitor disease outbreaks.},

  abstract = {Background Wastewater surveillance was proposed as an epidemiological tool to define the prevalence and evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. However, most implemented SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance projects were based on qPCR measurement of virus titers and did not address the mutational spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in the population. Methods We have implemented a nanopore RNA sequencing monitoring system in the city of Nice (France, 550,000 inhabitants). Between October 2020 and March 2021, we monthly analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 variants in 113 wastewater samples collected in the main wastewater treatment plant and 20 neighborhoods. Findings We initially detected the lineages predominant in Europe at the end of 2020 (B.1.160, B.1.177, B.1.367, B.1.474, and B.1.221). In January, a localized emergence of a variant (Spike:A522S) of the B.1.1.7 lineage occurred in one neighborhood. It rapidly spread and became dominant all over the city. Other variants of concern (B.1.351, P.1) were also detected in some neighborhoods, but at low frequency. Comparison with individual clinical samples collected during the same week showed that wastewater sequencing correctly identified the same lineages as those found in COVID-19 patients. Interpretation Wastewater sequencing allowed to document the diversity of SARS-CoV-2 sequences within the different neighborhoods of the city of Nice. Our results illustrate how sequencing of sewage samples can be used to track pathogen sequence diversity in the current pandemics and in future infectious disease outbreaks.

  abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for causing the COVID-19 pandemic, can be detected in untreated wastewater. Wastewater surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 complements clinical data by offering earlier community-level detection, removing underlying factors such as access to healthcare, sampling asymptomatic patients, and reaching a greater population. Here, we compare 24-hour composite samples from the influents of two different wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in South Carolina, USA: Columbia and Rock Hill. The sampling intervals span the months of July 2020 and January 2021, which cover the first and second waves of elevated SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19 clinical cases in these regions. We identify four signature mutations in the surface glycoprotein (spike) gene that are associated with the following variants of interest or concern, VOI or VOC (listed in parenthesis): S477N (B.1.526, Iota), T478K (B.1.617.2, Delta), D614G (present in all VOC as of May 2021), and H655Y (P.1, Gamma). The N501Y mutation, which is associated with three variants of concern, was identified in samples from July 2020, but not detected in January 2021 samples. Comparison of mutations identified in viral sequence databases such as NCBI Virus and GISAID indicated that wastewater sampling detected mutations that were present in South Carolina, but not reflected in the clinical data deposited into databases.},

  abstract = {Wastewater-based genomic surveillance of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus shows promise to complement genomic epidemiology efforts. Multiplex tiling PCR is a desirable approach for targeted genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater due to its low cost and rapid turnaround time. However, it is not clear how different multiplex tiling PCR primer schemes or wastewater sample matrices impact the resulting SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage. The objective of this work was to assess the performance of three different multiplex primer schemes, consisting of 150-bp, 400-bp, and 1,200-bp amplicons, as well as two wastewater sample matrices, influent wastewater and primary sludge, for targeted genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2. Wastewater samples were collected weekly from five municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the Metro Vancouver region of British Columbia, Canada during a period of increased coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) case counts from February to April 2021. RNA extracted from clarified influent wastewater provided significantly higher genome coverage (breadth and median depth) than primary sludge samples across all primer schemes. Shorter amplicons appeared to be more resilient to sample RNA degradation but were hindered by greater primer pool complexity in the 150-bp scheme. The identified optimal primer scheme (400 bp) and sample matrix (influent) were capable of detecting the emergence of mutations associated with genomic variants of concern, for which the daily wastewater load significantly correlated with clinical case counts. Taken together, these results provide guidance on best practices for implementing wastewater-based genomic surveillance and demonstrate its ability to inform epidemiology efforts by detecting genomic variants of concern circulating within a geographic region.},

  abstract = {Wastewater-based epidemiology has emerged as a promising tool to monitor pathogens in a population, particularly when clinical diagnostic capacities become overwhelmed. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), several jurisdictions have tracked viral concentrations in wastewater to inform public health authorities. While some studies have also sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes from wastewater, there have been relatively few direct comparisons between viral genetic diversity in wastewater and matched clinical samples from the same region and time period. Here we report sequencing and inference of SARS-CoV-2 mutations and variant lineages (including variants of concern) in 936 wastewater samples and thousands of matched clinical sequences collected between March 2020 and July 2021 in the cities of Montreal, Quebec City, and Laval, representing almost half the population of the Canadian province of Quebec. We benchmarked our sequencing and variant-calling methods on known viral genome sequences to establish thresholds for inferring variants in wastewater with confidence. We found that variant frequency estimates in wastewater and clinical samples are correlated over time in each city, with similar dates of first detection. Across all variant lineages, wastewater detection is more concordant with targeted outbreak sequencing than with semi-random clinical swab sampling. Most variants were first observed in clinical and outbreak data due to higher sequencing rate. However, wastewater sequencing is highly efficient, detecting more variants for a given sampling effort. This shows the potential for wastewater sequencing to provide useful public health data, especially at places or times when sufficient clinical sampling is infrequent or infeasible.},

  abstract = {As SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread and evolve, detecting emerging variants early is critical for public health interventions. Inferring lineage prevalence by clinical testing is infeasible at scale, especially in areas with limited resources, participation, or testing/sequencing capacity, which can also introduce biases1--3. SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in wastewater successfully tracks regional infection dynamics and provides less biased abundance estimates than clinical testing4,5. Tracking virus genomic sequences in wastewater would improve community prevalence estimates and detect emerging variants. However, two factors limit wastewater-based genomic surveillance: low-quality sequence data and inability to estimate relative lineage abundance in mixed samples. Here, we resolve these critical issues to perform a high-resolution, 295-day wastewater and clinical sequencing effort, in the controlled environment of a large university campus and the broader context of the surrounding county. We develop and deploy improved virus concentration protocols and deconvolution software that fully resolve multiple virus strains from wastewater. We detect emerging variants of concern up to 14 days earlier in wastewater samples, and identify multiple instances of virus spread not captured by clinical genomic surveillance. Our study provides a scalable solution for wastewater genomic surveillance that allows early detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants and identification of cryptic transmission.},

  abstract = {Throughout the course of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic there has been a need for approaches that enable rapid monitoring of public health using an unbiased and minimally invasive means. A major way this has been accomplished is through the regular assessment of wastewater samples by qRT-PCR to detect the prevalence of viral nucleic acid with respect to time and location. Further expansion of SARS-CoV-2 wastewater monitoring efforts to include the detection of variants of interest/concern through next-generation sequencing has enhanced the understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. In this report, we detail the results of a collaborative effort between public health and metropolitan wastewater management authorities and the University of Louisville to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic through the monitoring of aggregate wastewater samples over a period of 28 weeks. Through the use of next-generation sequencing approaches the polymorphism signatures of Variants of Concern/Interest were evaluated to determine the likelihood of their prevalence within the community on the basis of their relative dominance within sequence datasets. Our data indicate that wastewater monitoring of water quality treatment centers and smaller neighborhood-scale catchment areas is a viable means by which the prevalence and genetic variation of SARS-CoV-2 within a metropolitan community of approximately one million individuals may be monitored, as our efforts detected the introduction and emergence of variants of concern in the city of Louisville. Importantly, these efforts confirm that regional emergence and spread of variants of interest/concern may be detected as readily in aggregate wastewater samples as compared to the individual wastewater sheds. Furthermore, the information gained from these efforts enabled targeted public health efforts including increased outreach to at-risk communities and the deployment of mobile or community-focused vaccination campaigns.},

Wastewater sampling has consistently proven utility to understanding SARS-CoV-2 prevalence trends and genetic variation as it represents a less biased assessment of the corresponding communities. Here, we report that ongoing monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 genetic variation in samples obtained from the wastewatersheds of the city of Louisville in Jefferson county Kentucky has revealed the periodic reemergence of the Delta strain in the presence of the presumed dominant Omicron strain. Unlike previous SARS-CoV-2 waves/emergence events, the Delta reemergence events were geographically restricted in the community and failed to spread into other areas as determined by wastewater analyses. Moreover, the reemergence of the Delta strain did not correlate with vaccination rates as communities with lower relative vaccination have been, to date, not affected. Importantly, Delta reemergence events correlate with increased public health burdens, as indicated by increased daily case rates and mortality relative to non-Delta wastewatershed communities. While the underlying reasons for the reemergence of the Delta variant remain unclear, these data reaffirm the ongoing importance of wastewater genomic analyses towards understanding SARS-CoV-2 as it enters the endemic phase.},

Predicting lineage abundance from wastewater, however, is technically challenging. We show that by sequencing SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and applying algorithms initially used for transcriptome quantification, we can estimate lineage abundance in wastewater samples. We find high variability in signal among individual samples, but the overall trends match those observed from sequencing clinical samples. Thus, while clinical sequencing remains a more sensitive technique for population surveillance, wastewater sequencing can be used to monitor trends in mutant prevalence in situations where clinical sequencing is unavailable.},

  abstract = {Large-scale wastewater surveillance has the ability to greatly augment the tracking of infection dynamics especially in communities where the prevalence rates far exceed the testing capacity. However, current methods for viral detection in wastewater are severely lacking in terms of scaling up for high throughput. In the present study, we employed an automated magnetic-bead-based concentration approach for viral detection in sewage that can effectively be scaled up for processing 24 samples in a single 40-min run. The method compared favorably to conventionally used methods for viral wastewater concentrations with higher recovery efficiencies from input sample volumes as low as 10\,ml and can enable the processing of over 100 wastewater samples in a day. The sensitivity of the high-throughput protocol was shown to detect 1 asymptomatic individual in a building of 415 residents. Using the high-throughput pipeline, samples from the influent stream of the primary wastewater treatment plant of San Diego County (serving 2.3 million residents) were processed for a period of 13\,weeks. Wastewater estimates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral genome copies in raw untreated wastewater correlated strongly with clinically reported cases by the county, and when used alongside past reported case numbers and temporal information in an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model enabled prediction of new reported cases up to 3\,weeks in advance. Taken together, the results show that the high-throughput surveillance could greatly ameliorate comprehensive community prevalence assessments by providing robust, rapid estimates. IMPORTANCE Wastewater monitoring has a lot of potential for revealing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks before they happen because the virus is found in the wastewater before people have clinical symptoms. However, application of wastewater-based surveillance has been limited by long processing times specifically at the concentration step. Here we introduce a much faster method of processing the samples and show its robustness by demonstrating direct comparisons with existing methods and showing that we can predict cases in San Diego by a week with excellent accuracy, and 3 weeks with fair accuracy, using city sewage. The automated viral concentration method will greatly alleviate the major bottleneck in wastewater processing by reducing the turnaround time during epidemics.},

  abstract = {The continuing emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and variants of interest emphasizes the need for early detection and epidemiological surveillance of novel variants. We used genomic sequencing of 122 wastewater samples from three locations in Switzerland to monitor the local spread of B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta) and P.1 (Gamma) variants of SARS-CoV-2 at a population level. We devised a bioinformatics method named COJAC (Co-Occurrence adJusted Analysis and Calling) that uses read pairs carrying multiple variant-specific signature mutations as a robust indicator of low-frequency variants. Application of COJAC revealed that a local outbreak of the Alpha variant in two Swiss cities was observable in wastewater up to 13\,d before being first reported in clinical samples. We further confirmed the ability of COJAC to detect emerging variants early for the Delta variant by analysing an additional 1,339 wastewater samples. While sequencing data of single wastewater samples provide limited precision for the quantification of relative prevalence of a variant, we show that replicate and close-meshed longitudinal sequencing allow for robust estimation not only of the local prevalence but also of the transmission fitness advantage of any variant. We conclude that genomic sequencing and our computational analysis can provide population-level estimates of prevalence and fitness of emerging variants from wastewater samples earlier and on the basis of substantially fewer samples than from clinical samples. Our framework is being routinely used in large national projects in Switzerland and the UK.},

  abstract = {Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral genome in wastewater has proven to be useful for tracking the trends of virus prevalence within the community. The surveillance also provides precise and early detection of any new and circulating variants, which aids in response to viral outbreaks. Site-specific monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 variants provides valuable information on the prevalence of new or emerging variants in the community. We sequenced the genomic RNA of viruses present in the wastewater samples and analyzed for the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as other respiratory viruses for a period of one year to account for seasonal variations. The samples were collected from the Reno-Sparks metropolitan area on a weekly basis between November 2021 to November 2022. Samples were analyzed to detect the levels of SARS-CoV-2 genomic copies and variants identification. This study confirmed that wastewater monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 variants can be used for community surveillance and early detection of circulating variants and supports wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) as a complement to clinical respiratory virus testing as a healthcare response effort. Our study showed the persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus throughout the year compared to a seasonal presence of other respiratory viruses, implicating SARS-CoV-2's broad genetic diversity and strength to persist and infect susceptible hosts. Through secondary analysis, we further identified antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes in the same wastewater samples and found WBE to be a feasible tool for community AMR detection and monitoring. HIGHLIGHTS/KEY FINDINGSWBE better represents regional virus prevalence under declining testing and clinical reporting rates.SARS-CoV-2 virus was present throughout the year compared to a seasonal prevalence of other respiratory viral pathogens.SARS-CoV-2 variant monitoring via WBE can provide insights into regionally co-circulating respiratory viruses, causing flu-like symptoms.WBE-AMR gene monitoring is feasible and provides valuable insight into regional AMRs.Our workflow enables the estimation of the relative proportion of different variants in any pooled samples. {$<$}img class="highwire-fragment fragment-image" alt="Figure" src="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/medrxiv/early/2023/01/07/2023.01.05.23284236/F1.medium.gif" width="440" height="155"/{$>$}Download figureOpen in new tab},

  abstract = {Monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater (WW) is a promising tool for epidemiological surveillance, correlating not only viral RNA levels with the infection dynamics within the population, but also to viral diversity. However, the complex mixture of viral lineages in WW samples makes tracking of specific variants or lineages circulating in the population a challenging task. We sequenced sewage samples of 9 WW-catchment areas within the city of Rotterdam, used specific signature mutations from individual SARS-CoV-2 lineages to estimate their relative abundances in WW and compared them against those observed in clinical genomic surveillance of infected individuals between September 2020 and December 2021. We showed that especially for dominant lineages, the median of the frequencies of signature mutations coincides with the occurrence of those lineages in Rotterdam's clinical genomic surveillance. This, along with digital droplet RT-PCR targeting signature mutations of specific variants of concern (VOCs), showed that several VOCs emerged, became dominant and were replaced by the next VOC in Rotterdam at different time points during the study. In addition, single nucleotide variant (SNV) analysis provided evidence that spatio-temporal clusters can also be discerned from WW samples. We were able to detect specific SNVs in sewage, including one resulting in the Q183H amino acid change in the Spike gene, that was not captured by clinical genomic surveillance. Our results highlight the potential use of WW samples for genomic surveillance, increasing the set of epidemiological tools to monitor SARS-CoV-2 diversity.},

  abstract = {The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has reinforced the longstanding concern that we are underprepared to respond to (re)emerging pathogens, especially respiratory viruses. Three years after the emergence of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there have been more than 765 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and 6.9 million deaths worldwide as of May 10th, 2023. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused tremendous suffering, economic cost, and disruption in everyday life. In this dissertation, I explore innovative surveillance strategies for detecting and monitoring SARS-CoV-2 and other (re)emerging viruses of public health concern. In collaboration with state and local public health agencies, we applied these surveillance strategies to monitor SARS-CoV-2 in the community to improve public health awareness and create a framework to help make data-driven decisions for implementing COVID-19 risk mitigation strategies. Furthermore, we explore how we can use these innovative surveillance strategies to complement traditional testing strategies to help monitor known, understudied, and unknown viruses and improve preparedness for future outbreaks. Chapter 1 gives an overview of (re)emerging viruses since the 20th century and discusses a need for improved surveillance strategies to detect and characterize (re)emerging viruses effectively. This chapter will discuss the importance of improving surveillance strategies to promote a more rapid and efficient outbreak response. I will also use the COVID-19 pandemic as an example of how traditional surveillance strategies were used to inform the public health COVID-19 response and their limitations. Then, I will talk about how environmental surveillance strategies have been used to complement surveillance strategies that rely on individual testing. I discuss how these environmental surveillance strategies could be applied to other pathogens in the future to complement traditional surveillance strategies to improve routine public health surveillance, outbreak response, and pandemic preparedness. In Chapter 2, I describe our work developing and implementing a rapid, mobile SARS-CoV-2 testing strategy for frequent testing of individuals to improve surveillance in K-12 schools, workplaces, and a university campus. During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, the availability of diagnostic testing for population surveillance around the United States was limited because of testing supply shortages, inequalities in the distribution of COVID-19 testing access, and testing guidelines set by public health officials. As a result, the testing systems for COVID-19 provided case counts that were, at best, crude estimates for disease burden and transmission risk. We evaluated a simple, outdoor, mobile, colorimetric reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay workflow where self-collected saliva is tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Overall, we demonstrated that individuals with basic molecular biology skills could implement a rapid testing method outside the traditional laboratory setting. Furthermore, RT-LAMP testing could effectively identify asymptomatic individuals who would not have met the criteria for symptom-based testing modalities. This study provided proof-of-concept and guidance for how decentralized rapid testing could be implemented in a mobile-testing scenario, which may be especially useful in resource-limited settings and future outbreaks. In Chapter 3, I describe our work to develop an alternative environmental surveillance strategy to detect and track the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens in congregate settings considered high-risk for close-contact, indoor transmission. To evaluate the utility of routine air surveillance in real-world congregate settings, we deployed a network of active air samplers to monitor the presence of genetic material from SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens across communities in the Upper Midwestern states of Wisconsin and Minnesota. We applied several nucleic acid amplification tests to detect SARS-CoV-2 and 40 other respiratory pathogens. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 genetic material could be detected in continuous air samples collected from various real-world settings at daily and weekly sampling intervals. Furthermore, our air sample network revealed distinct differences in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus in Dane County, Wisconsin, which was concordant with reports from local public health agencies. We used deep sequencing to identify newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in congregate settings, showing that the virus genetic material collected by air samples paralleled the longitudinal detection of the same lineages transmitted in the community. This study suggests that air surveillance is feasible in real-world settings and could be used to complement other surveillance methods to improve public health awareness and response. In Chapter 4, I describe our work to apply a pathogen-agnostic sequencing approach to air samples to identify and characterize known and understudied human viruses. Environmental surveillance strategies have rapidly evolved since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and have been proposed as important complements to existing pathogen surveillance systems to improve routine public health surveillance, outbreak response, and pandemic preparedness. However, many air surveillance studies have relied on pathogen-specific nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) and sequencing methods to detect SARS-CoV-2 viral genetic material in air samples. This provides a limited picture of the overall pathogens captured from the air. The use of pathogen-agnostic sequencing approaches and metagenomic analysis on air samples could significantly improve the detection of viruses and other pathogens. We demonstrate that pathogen-agnostic sequencing can detect several common and understudied human respiratory and enteric viruses in a variety of congregate settings. Furthermore, we show that this method can be used to characterize viruses collected in air samples and track their presence over time, which could provide valuable information for improving public health awareness. The work in this thesis provides a foundation for others to improve the sensitivity, interpretation, and implementation of these alternative surveillance strategies. Building upon this work could increase our capacity to detect and track (re)emerging pathogens in real-time, without relying on test-seeking behavior, in order to mount a more efficient public health response. The emergence of zoonotic viruses in the human population is inevitable. When that time comes, we will need innovative surveillance strategies to help deploy a rapid, safe, and effective response to limit their impact.},

While previous exist for identifying cryptic mutations in specific regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, there is a need for computational tools capable of tracking cryptic mutations across the entire genome and at scale.

We evaluated Crykey on SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 3175 wastewater samples and more than 14000 clinical samples. Our results are threefold, we show: 1) Crykey can accurately identify cryptic lineages that are rare or missing in existing databases ; 2) the emergence of cryptic lineage can be related to increased transmission rates in the communities, and 3) some cryptic lineages in wastewater mirror intra-host low frequency co-occurring variants in individuals. In summary, Crykey facilitates rapid and comprehensive identification of SARS-CoV-2 cryptic mutations in wastewater samples.},

  abstract = {The use of RNA sequencing from wastewater samples is a valuable way for estimating infection dynamics and circulating lineages of SARS-CoV-2. This approach is independent from testing individuals and can therefore become the key tool to monitor this and potentially other viruses. However, it is equally important to develop easily accessible and scalable tools which can highlight critical changes in infection rates and dynamics over time across different locations given sequencing data from wastewater. Here, we provide an analysis of lineage dynamics in Berlin and New York City using wastewater sequencing and present PiGx SARS-CoV-2, a highly reproducible computational analysis pipeline with comprehensive reports. This end-to-end pipeline includes all steps from raw data to shareable reports, additional taxonomic analysis, deconvolution and geospatial time series analyses. Using simulated datasets (in silico generated and spiked-in samples) we could demonstrate the accuracy of our pipeline calculating proportions of Variants of Concern (VOC) from environmental as well as pre-mixed samples (spiked-in). By applying our pipeline on a dataset of wastewater samples from Berlin between February 2021 and January 2022, we could reconstruct the emergence of B.1.1.7(alpha) in February/March 2021 and the replacement dynamics from B.1.617.2 (delta) to BA.1 and BA.2 (omicron) during the winter of 2021/2022. Using data from very-short-reads generated in an industrial scale setting, we could see even higher accuracy in our deconvolution. Lastly, using a targeted sequencing dataset from New York City (receptor-binding-domain (RBD) only), we could reproduce the results recovering the proportions of the so-called cryptic lineages shown in the original study. Overall our study provides an in-depth analysis reconstructing virus lineage dynamics from wastewater. While applying our tool on a wide range of different datasets (from different types of wastewater sample locations and sequenced with different methods), we show that PiGx SARS-CoV-2 can be used to identify new mutations and detect any emerging new lineages in a highly automated and scalable way. Our approach can support efforts to establish continuous monitoring and early-warning projects for detecting SARS-CoV-2 or any other pathogen.},

  abstract = {Background: Positive correlations have been reported between wastewater SARS-CoV-2 concentrations and a community's burden of infection, disease or both. However, previous studies mostly compared wastewater to clinical case counts or nonrepresentative convenience samples, limiting their quantitative potential. Objectives: This study examined whether wastewater SARS-CoV-2 concentrations could provide better estimations for SARS-CoV-2 community prevalence than reported cases of COVID-19. In addition, this study tested whether wastewater-based epidemiology methods could identify neighborhood-level COVID-19 hotspots and SARS-CoV-2 variants. Methods: Community SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was estimated from eight randomized door-to-door nasal swab sampling events in six Oregon communities of disparate size, location, and demography over a 10-month period. Simultaneously, wastewater SARS-CoV-2 concentrations were quantified at each community's wastewater treatment plant and from 22 Newport, Oregon, neighborhoods. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was sequenced from all positive wastewater and nasal swab samples. Clinically reported case counts were obtained from the Oregon Health Authority. Results: Estimated community SARS-CoV-2 prevalence ranged from 8 to 1,687/10,000 persons. Community wastewater SARS-CoV-2 concentrations ranged from 2.9 to 5.1\,\,log10 gene copies per liter. Wastewater SARS-CoV-2 concentrations were more highly correlated (Pearson's r=0.96; R2=0.91) with community prevalence than were clinically reported cases of COVID-19 (Pearson's r=0.85; R2=0.73). Monte Carlo simulations indicated that wastewater SARS-CoV-2 concentrations were significantly better than clinically reported cases at estimating prevalence (p\&lt;0.05). In addition, wastewater analyses determined neighborhood-level COVID-19 hot spots and identified SARS-CoV-2 variants (B.1 and B.1.399) at the neighborhood and city scales. Discussion: The greater reliability of wastewater SARS-CoV-2 concentrations over clinically reported case counts was likely due to systematic biases that affect reported case counts, including variations in access to testing and underreporting of asymptomatic cases. With these advantages, combined with scalability and low costs, wastewater-based epidemiology can be a key component in public health surveillance of COVID-19 and other communicable infections. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10289},

To test how major international events influence the spread of new variants we have sequenced SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the wastewater samples of Davos, Landquart, Lostallo, and St. Moritz in the Swiss canton of Grisons in the time around the international sports competitions in Davos and St. Moritz in December 2021, and additionally in May 2022 and January 2023 in Davos and St. Moritz during the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos. The prevalence of the variants identified from the wastewater sequencing data showed that the Omicron variant BA.1 had spread in Davos and St. Moritz during the international sporting events hosted there in December 2021. This spread was associated with an increase in case numbers, while it was not observed in Landquart and Lostallo. Another instance of new variant spread occurred during the WEF in January 2023, when the Omicron variant BA.2.75 arrived in Davos but not in St. Moritz. We can therefore conclude that major international events promote the spread of new variants in the respective host region, which has important implications for the protective measures that should be taken.},

  abstract = {Wastewater is a discarded human by-product, but its analysis may help us understand the health of populations. Epidemiologists first analyzed wastewater to track outbreaks of poliovirus decades ago, but so-called wastewater-based epidemiology was reinvigorated to monitor SARS-CoV-2 levels while bypassing the difficulties and pit falls of individual testing. Current approaches overlook the activity of most human viruses and preclude a deeper understanding of human virome community dynamics. Here, we conduct a comprehensive sequencing-based analysis of 363 longitudinal wastewater samples from ten distinct sites in two major cities. Critical to detection is the use of a viral probe capture set targeting thousands of viral species or variants. Over 450 distinct pathogenic viruses from 28 viral families are observed, most of which have never been detected in such samples. Sequencing reads of established pathogens and emerging viruses correlate to clinical data sets of SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus, and monkeypox viruses, outlining the public health utility of this approach. Viral communities are tightly organized by space and time. Finally, the most abundant human viruses yield sequence variant information consistent with regional spread and evolution. We reveal the viral landscape of human wastewater and its potential to improve our understanding of outbreaks, transmission, and its effects on overall population health.},

  abstract = {There is a need to enhance the public health surveillance infrastructure by leveraging novel surveillance tools that can provide comprehensive, reliable, and rapid surveillance data to improve community health outcomes. Currently, the standard approach to generating public health surveillance data is by use of clinical diagnostics which severely underestimates community-level dynamics of diseases due to its dependence on community access to timely healthcare and individual health-seeking behaviors for reporting. Wastewater-based epidemiology is a novel surveillance tool that analyzes wastewater, as a pooled community sample, for biomarkers of disease to monitor and assess the overall health of a community by tracking trends, detecting outbreaks, and monitoring the genomic diversity of circulating pathogens. Wastewater-based epidemiology has the potential to meet the needs in public health surveillance to improve community health outcomes. I hypothesize that wastewater-based epidemiology can provide comprehensive, reliable, and rapid surveillance data to inform implementation of timely and effective public health actions. The objective of my study is to assess and implement novel quantitative- and genomic-based analytical methods used for wastewater-based epidemiology to better understand disease dynamics within a community. I applied these methods to two diseases that have major impacts and a high burden on human health: COVID-19 and Salmonellosis. Through field- and lab-based experiments, I aim to optimize, implement, and assess the operational capacity and effectiveness of wastewater-based epidemiology as a novel tool for monitoring community health. Wastewater-based epidemiology can provide a cost-effective complement to fill the gaps left by traditional clinical reporting for community-level disease surveillance. This project will provide two analytical tools and present a model for the implementation of wastewater-based epidemiology in communities to aid in public health surveillance.},

  abstract = {During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, genome-based wastewater surveillance sequencing has been a powerful tool for public health to monitor circulating and emerging viral variants. As a medium, wastewater is very complex because of its mixed matrix nature, which makes the deconvolution of wastewater samples more difficult. Here we introduce a gold standard dataset constructed from synthetic viral control mixtures of known composition, spiked into a wastewater RNA matrix and sequenced on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies platform. We compare the performance of eight of the most commonly used deconvolution tools in identifying SARS-CoV-2 variants present in these mixtures. The software evaluated was primarily chosen for its relevance to the CDC wastewater surveillance reporting protocol, which until recently employed a pipeline that incorporates results from four deconvolution methods: Freyja, kallisto, Kraken2/Bracken, and LCS. We also tested Lollipop, a deconvolution method used by the Swiss SARS-CoV2 Sequencing Consortium, and three recently-published methods: lineagespot, Alcov, and VaQuERo. We found that the commonly used software Freyja outperformed the other CDC pipeline tools in correct identification of lineages present in the control mixtures, and that the newer method VaQuERo was similarly accurate, with minor differences in the ability of the two methods to avoid false negatives and suppress false positives. These results provide insight into the effect of the tiling primer scheme and wastewater RNA extract matrix on viral sequencing and data deconvolution outcomes.

Wastewater-based surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments has been shown to be an effective way to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic at the population level. Wastewater is a complex sample matrix affected by environmental factors and PCR inhibitors, causing insufficient coverage in sequencing, for example. Subsequently, results where part of the genome does not have sufficient coverage are not uncommon. To identify variants and their proportions in wastewater over time, we utilized next-generation sequencing with the ARTIC Network's primer set and bioinformatics pipeline to evaluate the presence of variants in partial genome data. Based on the wastewater data from November 2021 to February 2022, the Delta variant was dominant until mid-December in Helsinki, Finland's capital, and thereafter in late December 2022 Omicron became the most common variant. At the same time, the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 outcompeted the previous Delta variant in Finland in new COVID-19 cases. The SARS-CoV-2 variant findings from wastewater are in agreement with the variant information obtained from the patient samples when visually comparing trends in the sewerage network area. This indicates that the sequencing of wastewater is an effective way to monitor temporal and spatial trends of SARS-CoV-2 variants at the population level.},

  abstract = {The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has shown that wastewater (WW) surveillance is an effective means of tracking the emergence of viral lineages in communities, arriving by many routes including via transportation hubs. In Ontario, numerous municipal WWTPs participate in WW surveillance of infectious disease targets such as SARS-CoV-2 by qPCR and whole genome sequencing (WGS). The Greater Toronto Airports Authority (GTAA), operator of Toronto Pearson International Airport (Toronto Pearson), has been participating in WW surveillance since January 2022. As a major international airport in Canada and the largest national hub, this airport is an ideal location for tracking globally emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs). In this study, WW collected from Toronto Pearson\&amp;rsquo;s two terminals and pooled aircraft sewage was processed for WGS using a tiled-amplicon approach targeting the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Data generated was analyzed to monitor trends SARS-CoV-2 lineage frequencies. Initial detections of emerging lineages were compared between Toronto Pearson WW samples, municipal WW samples collected from the surrounding regions, and Ontario clinical data as published by Public Health Ontario. Results enabled the early detection of VOCs and individual mutations emerging in Ontario. On average, emergence of novel lineages at the airport ahead of clinical detections was 1\&amp;ndash;4 weeks, and up to 16 weeks. This project illustrates the efficacy of WW surveillance at transitory transportation hubs and sets an example that could be applied to other viruses as part of a pandemic preparedness strategy and to provide monitoring on a mass scale.},

  abstract = {The ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is a significant concern, especially with the decrease in clinical sequencing efforts, which impedes the ability of public health sectors to prepare for the emergence of new variants and potential COVID-19 outbreaks. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has been proposed as a surveillance program to detect and monitor the SARS-CoV-2 variants being transmitted in communities. However, research is limited in evaluating the effectiveness of wastewater collection at sentinel sites for monitoring disease prevalence and variant dynamics, especially in terms of inferring the epidemic patterns on a broader scale, such as at the state/province level. This study utilized a multiplexed tiling amplicon-based sequencing (ATOPlex) to track the longitudinal dynamics of variant of concern (VOC) in wastewater collected from municipalities in Queensland, Australia, spanning from 2020 to 2022. We demonstrated that wastewater epidemiology measured by ATOPlex exhibited a strong and consistent correlation with the number of daily confirmed cases. The VOC dynamics observed in wastewater closely aligned with the dynamic profile reported by clinical sequencing. Wastewater sequencing has the potential to provide early warning information for emerging variants. These findings suggest that WBE at sentinel sites, coupled with sensitive sequencing methods, provides a reliable and long-term disease surveillance strategy.},

Results In this work, we present a novel technique based on non-negative matrix factorization which is able to extract novel lineage definitions by analyzing data from across different samples.We test the method both on synthetic and real wastewater sequencing data.We show that the technique is able to determine major lineages such as Omicron and Delta as well as sub-lineages such as BA.5.2.1. Conclusions We provide a method for determining emerging lineages in wastewater without the need for genomic data from clinical samples. This could be used for routine monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 as well as other emerging viral pathogens in wastewater. Additionally, it may be used to derive more sequences for viruses with fewer complete genomes.},

Over the course of 12-months, from June 2022 to May 2023, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was consistently detected in wastewater samples collected from open drains across various regions of the state. Whole genome sequencing revealed the presence of 22 distinct SARS-CoV-2 lineages, with the Omicron variant dominating from July to September 2022, followed by the XBB variant from February to April 2023, along with other variants such as BF, BQ, CH, and BA.2.86, albeit with lower frequencies. Wastewater surveillance provided early insights into viral transmission, complementing clinical surveillance. Notably, our study detected emerging variants before clinical reporting, highlighting the potential of WBE for early detection. Our findings underscore the importance of WBE in tracking and managing the spread of COVID-19, especially in areas with limited clinical testing. This study highlights the significance of WBE in global infectious disease surveillance especially under low to middle-income countries (LMICs).}

Unlike the Delta variant, the emergence of the Omicron variant and its sublineages as variants of concern has posed a challenge in using characteristic mutations for wastewater surveillance. In this study, we monitored the temporal and spatial variation of SARS-CoV-2 variants by including all the detected mutations and compared whether limiting the analyses to characteristic mutations for variants like Omicron impact the outcomes. We collected 24-hour composite samples from 15 wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in Hesse and sequenced 164 wastewater samples with a targeted sequencing approach from September 2021 to March 2022. Our results show that comparing the number of all the mutations against the number of the characteristic mutations reveals a different outcome. A different temporal variation was observed for the ORF1a and S gene. As Omicron became dominant, we observed an increase in the overall number of mutations. Based on the characteristic mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 variants, a decreasing trend for the number of ORF1a and S gene mutations was noticed, though the number of known characteristic mutations in both genes is higher in Omicron than Delta.},
